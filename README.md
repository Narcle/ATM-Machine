Unit testing is a software testing method that tests individual units or components of a software program. It is typically done by the developer of the software prior to system testing. Unit testing helps to identify bugs and errors early on in the development process, and it is easier to fix bugs at this stage than when the entire system is tested. Unit testing also helps to ensure that the individual units of the program are functioning properly and that they are interacting with each other as expected. The benefit of unit testing is that it helps to improve the overall quality of a software product, as it reduces the amount of time needed to fix bugs and errors. Additionally, unit testing helps to reduce the cost of development by eliminating the need for costly debugging and system testing.
